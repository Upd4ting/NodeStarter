# NodeStarter
Template to start doing web application on node.js

# How to use it

- First you need to install rethinkdb if you are on a different operating system than windows. If you're on windows, the executable of rethinkdb is embeded in theses sources.
- Then just do npm install
- Then npm run database (Initialise database table)
- Then npm run start (Start web server)

# What's in there ? 

- Login/Register system exploiting rethinkdb as database
- Express web server
- Pug templating system
- Rethinkdbdash (A cool driver for rethinkdb)
- Handle json and multipart form server side

Keep in mind that's not the best structure, that's just a place where to start with node.js
